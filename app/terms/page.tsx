          Lucerna AI is an experimental academic project provided "as-is" for educational and research purposes. These

        </p>

        <h2>1. Non-Commercial Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          Lucerna AI is currently not a business entity and is not monetized. All services are provided free of charge.
          Use of the platform is limited to academic testing, prototyping, and feedback collection.
        </p>

        <h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You agree:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide accurate data (resumes/job descriptions) for tailoring purposes</li>
          <li>Not to use the platform for illegal, abusive, or harmful purposes</li>
          <li>
            Not to upload confidential, proprietary, or personally sensitive information without proper anonymization
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          You retain ownership of your uploaded content. We may store and analyze it internally to improve our academic
          work, research findings, and system accuracy.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Lucerna AI is offered with no warranties or guarantees. We are not responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accuracy or outcomes of AI-generated resume suggestions</li>
          <li>Loss of data, career impact, or system interruptions</li>
          <li>External misuse of user-shared resumes or job descriptions</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Future Transition to Commercial Use</h2>
        <p>Lucerna AI reserves the right to evolve into a commercial product in the future. In such case, we will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Notify all users via the site and email</li>
          <li>Update these terms and request new consent before any commercial rollout</li>
